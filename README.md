# Audio Message Player

Audio Message Player is a macOS application designed to display and play all audio messages from the Messages app on your Mac. The native macOS Messages app does not provide a way to view or manage audio messages directly, and this app fills that gap.

## Features
- Displays all audio messages from the Messages app in a user-friendly interface.
- Allows playback of audio messages with play, pause, and scrubber controls.
- Supports viewing  file name and date metadata.
- Context menu option to open audio files in Finder.
- Fully written in Objective-C and compatible with macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later
